The projects in this repository are categorized based on the main subfields of AI:

- **NLP** - Natural Language Processing: It deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
- **CV** - Computer Vision: It involves the development of algorithms to help machines interpret and understand the visual world.
- **ML** - Machine Learning: It is the study of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. **Here you can find the classic models.**
- **DL** - Deep Learning: It is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to model and process complex data.
- **RL** - Reinforcement Learning: It is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.

## Project Structure
Each project in this repository is organized into its respective subfield directory, containing the source code, documentation, and any necessary resources.

## Getting Started
To get started with the projects in this repository, navigate to the specific subfield directory of interest and explore the individual project folders. Each project may contain its own README file with detailed instructions on how to run and use the code.
