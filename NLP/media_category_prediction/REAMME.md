# Netflix Category Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the categories of Netflix movies and TV shows using different machine-learning techniques. 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about Netflix titles such as description, category, and more.

## Steps Involved
1. **Getting the Data**
    - The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle website.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - **Check for Missing Data:** Fill in missing data if needed.
    - **Check for Duplicates:** Remove duplicates if needed.
    - **Standardize or Unify Features:** Adjust features if needed.
        - Visualize the Data
        - Make the Categories Unified
        - Convert the Unified Categories to the Final Categories
        - Convert the Final Categories to Short Categories

### From here on I used different techniques and models as well as how to approach the data that had been preprocessed before. 

3. **Prepare the Data for Training & Testing**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. **Data Preparation & Splitting**
    - Prepare the data for training and testing.

5. **Feature Extraction**
    - Extract features from the data.

6. **Model Selection and Training**
    - Choose and train appropriate models.

7. **Model Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the performance of the trained models.

8. **Predict Categories for New Descriptions**
    - Functionality to predict categories for new descriptions.
